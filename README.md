Empathy-Adwaita-Theme
=====================

Empathy theme that integrates with Gnome 3's default theme, Adwaita

Based off the 'Boxes' theme included by default with Empathy

All credit goes to the gnome project. I simply changed some color values and CSS.

I welcome any contributions for Adwaita light.


Installation
============

1. Put the 'Adwaita.AdiumMessageStyle' folder in ~/.local/share/adium/message-styles/ (create any directories that don't already exist)

2. Restart Empathy (killall empathy && empathy &)

3. Go to Preferences > Themes, and select the 'Adwaita' theme.
